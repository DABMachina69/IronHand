Lets assemble some strong codes here!
By creating a good database of strong codes, together we 
could use these codes to create large and helpful softwares and programs. 
All kinds of computer codes are welcome. 
These codes are not going to be used for any unfriendly or harmful purpouses. 
Thanks for your cooporation!
